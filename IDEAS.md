## ExtraneousCraft Idea and Contribution List:

I have created this list/file as the future idea source of ExtraneousCraft so the mod keeps it's unique feel... Ideas that are contributed to this file are for exclusive use in ExtraneousCraft but there's nothing wrong to be inspired by them and make/use something fairly new out of them... I allow anyone to reach read or edit this file to contribute/suggest more ideas do not forget to write the name of the author so you get your credit in the mod...

**1. Infused Herbs/Plants:**

These plans generate only in certain biomes and in certain conditions they can be harvested as Infused Seeds or Infused Plant by the use of ONLY a Herbal Accumulator these seeds can be used to plant more but they'll only grow at dark places and night time... Every plant has a chance to drop 0 - 1 seeds so mass reproduction is pretty unlikely hovever by the use of a Void heliograph these infused herbs can be extracted into Infused Extract which can/will be later used for production of machines, items and such.
