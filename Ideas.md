## ExtraneousCraft Idea and Contribution List:

***

**1. Infused Herbs/Plants:**
These plans generate only in certain biomes and in certain conditions they can be harvested as Infused Seeds or Infused Plant by the use of ONLY a Herbal Accumulator these seeds can be used to plant more but they'll only grow at dark places and night time... Every plant has a chance to drop 0 - 1 seeds so mass reproduction is pretty unlikely hovever by the use of a Void heliograph these infused herbs can be extracted into Infused Extract which can/will be later used for production of machines, items and such.
